# Contribution Guidelines

Please use English for all contributions

At the moment, here's the workflow we follow for sending a feature request.

1. Open/search existing Github issues for the feature you're adding
2. Checkout `devel` branch and make a `short-lived` branch (based off of `devel`) ..briefly named after the feature you're adding.
3. Make sure you send mircro - Pull Requests (PRs) containing small changes, so it's easier to review and also easier for you to solve conflicts.
4. Send PRs to `devel` branch only. We'll use changes from multiple commits over time to rebase them onto master alognwith a `CHANGELOG`.
5. Close/Refer to the issue specific to the PR. For example, for issue #14, add `fixes #14` to the first line of commit message
6. Add a `signed off by` message in your commits. Helps distribute incentives to the community. We'll redesign this part in near future.
