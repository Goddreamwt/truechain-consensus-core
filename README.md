## Feedback

Feedback is greatly appreciated. We're a blend of `py-go-c++` devs looking to merge ideas and we may err at times in the realm of language paradigms and correct design approach. We're hoping to find you (yes you!) and incentivize you for auditing our codebase, polish the erm out of it and teach us how to fish in this process. Feel free to open issues / contact us on our channels. 

## Contributing

We have a list of important tasks from Truechain Foundation. We welcome people who have related background to join
